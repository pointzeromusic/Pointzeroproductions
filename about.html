  <h2>About the Artist</h2>
  <p>POINTZERO is a hard-hitting artist emerging from the same era as bands like Puddle of Mudd, Limp Bizkit, HARDY, Badflower, Breaking Benjamin, Seether, and Three Days Grace. Their raw sound and emotional grit place them firmly in the lineage of early 2000s rock and modern alt-metal.</p>
