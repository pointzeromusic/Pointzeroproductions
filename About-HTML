    Point Zero is a genre-blending force formed from the ashes of static and silence. Known for our raw energy, 
    heavy riffs, and immersive soundscapes, we fuse elements of alternative rock, electronic tones, and emotional storytelling. 
    Based in [Your City], our mission is to shake speakers and souls.
